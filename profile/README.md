Welcome to the Stealth Rocket Github organization!

We are building **Dispatch**, a platform for developing scalable & reliable distributed systems.

Dispatch provides a simple programming model based on *Distributed Coroutines*, allowing complex, dynamic workflows to be expressed with regular code and control flow.

Dispatch schedules function calls across a fleet of service instances, incorporating fair scheduling, transparent retry of failed operations, and durability.

To get started, follow the instructions to [sign up for Dispatch][signup] ðŸš€ and check out our [Python SDK][python-sdk]!
