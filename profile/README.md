Welcome to the Stealth Rocket Github organization!

We are building **Dispatch**, a platform to develop reliable distributed systems.
Dispatch provides a simple programming model based on durable coroutines to managed
the scheduling of function calls across a fleet of service instances.
Orchestration of function calls is managed by Dispatch, providing **fair scheduling**,
transparent **retry of failed operations**, and **durability**.

To get started, follow the instructions to [sign up for Dispatch][signup] ðŸš€ and check out our [Python SDK][python-sdk]!
