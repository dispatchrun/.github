Welcome to the Stealth Rocket Github organization!

We are building Dispatch, a platform to develop reliable distributed systems. Dispatch provides a simple programming model based on durable coroutines to manage the scheduling of function calls across a fleet of service instances. Orchestration of function calls is managed by Dispatch, providing fair scheduling, transparent retry of failed operations, and durability.

To get started, follow the instructions to [sign up for Dispatch][signup] ðŸš€ and check out our [Python SDK][python-sdk]!
